This repository contains the devleopment files for the OCR module in the Faxmydoc project.

Current state:
    - main depends on templar which depends on sax
    - as temporary placeholders to get the dependency system working, the following functions are implemented:
        - in sax.cpp:     Sax::Testing123() which depends on nothing
        - in templar.cpp: Templar::Testing456() which depends on Sax::Testing123()
        - in main.cpp:    main() which depends on Templar456()

Issues:
    - upon compiling main(), an error is thrown claiming an undefined reference to Templar::Testing456()
